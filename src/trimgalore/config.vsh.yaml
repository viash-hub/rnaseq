        type: integer
        description: Trim low-quality ends (below the specified Phred score) from reads in addition to adapter removal. For RRBS samples, quality trimming will be performed first, and adapter trimming is carried in a second round. Other files are quality and adapter trimmed in a single pass. The algorithm is the same as the one used by BWA (Subtract INT from all qualities; compute partial sums from all indices to the end of the sequence; cut sequence at the index at which the sum is minimal).

          Adapter sequence to be trimmed. If not specified explicitly, Trim Galore will try to auto-detect whether the Illumina universal, Nextera transposase or Illumina small RNA adapter sequence was used. A single base may also be given as e.g. -a A{10}, to be expanded to -a AAAAAAAAAA. 
          At a special request, multiple adapters can also be specified like so: 
            -a  " AGCTCCCG -a TTTCATTATAT -a TTTATTCGGATTTAT" -a2 " AGCTAGCG -a TCTCTTATAT -a TTTCGGATTTAT",

        description: Discard reads that became shorter than the specified length because of either quality or adapter trimming. A value of '0' effectively disables this behaviour. For paired-end files, both reads of a read-pair need to be longer than the specified length to be printed out to validated paired-end files.

      - name: --clip_R2 
        type: integer
        description: Instructs TrimGalore to remove given number bp from the 5' end of read 2 (paired-end reads only). This may be useful if the qualities were very poor, or if there is some sort of unwanted bias at the 5' end. For paired-end BS-Seq, it is recommended to remove the first few bp because the end-repair reaction may introduce a bias towards low methylation.

        description: Instructs Trim Galore to remove spacified number of bp from the 3' end of read 1 (or single-end reads) AFTER adapter/quality trimming has been performed. This may remove some  bias from the 3' end that is not directly related to adapter sequence or basecall quality.

      - name: --nextseq 
        type: integer 
        description: This enables the option '--nextseq-trim=3'CUTOFF' within Cutadapt, which will set a quality cutoff (that is normally given with -q instead), but qualities of G bases are ignored. This trimming is in common for the NextSeq- and NovaSeq-platforms, where basecalls without any signal are called as high-quality G bases. This is mutually exlusive with '-q INT'.

      - name: --basename
        type: string

    arguments: 
      - name: --hardtrim5 
        type: integer
        description: Instead of performing adapter-/quality trimming, this option will simply hard-trim sequences to <int> bp at the 5'-end. Once hard-trimming of files is complete, Trim Galore will exit. Hard-trimmed output files will end in .<int>_5prime.fq(.gz). 
        required: false

        type: integer
        description: Instead of performing adapter-/quality trimming, this option will simply hard-trim sequences to <int> bp at the 3'-end. Once hard-trimming of files is complete, Trim Galore will exit. Hard-trimmed output files will end in .<int>_3prime.fq(.gz).

        type: boolean
        description: In this mode, reads are trimmed in a specific way that is currently used for the Mouse Epigenetic Clock.
        required: false
      - name: --polyA
        type: boolean
        description: This is a new, still experimental, trimming mode to identify and remove poly-A tails from sequences. When --polyA is selected, Trim Galore attempts to identify from the first supplied sample whether sequences contain more often a stretch of either 'AAAAAAAAAA' or 'TTTTTTTTTT'. This determines if Read 1 of a paired-end end file, or single-end files, are trimmed for PolyA or PolyT. In case of paired-end sequencing, Read2 is trimmed for the complementary base from the start of the reads. The auto-detection uses a default of A{20} for Read1 (3'-end trimming) and T{150} for Read2 (5'-end trimming). These values may be changed manually using the options -a and -a2. In addition to trimming the sequences, white spaces are replaced with _ and it records in the read ID how many bases were trimmed so it can later be used to identify PolyA trimmed sequences. This is currently done by writing tags to both the start ("32:A:") and end ("_PolyA:32") of the reads. The poly-A trimming mode expects that sequences were both adapter and quality  before looking for Poly-A tails, and it is the user's responsibility to carry out an initial round of trimming. 
        required: false
      - name: --implicon    
        type: boolean
        description: | 
          This is a special mode of operation for paired-end data, such as required for the IMPLICON method, where a UMI sequence is getting transferred from the start of Read 2 to the readID of both reads. Following this, Trim Galore will exit. In it's current implementation, the UMI carrying reads come in the following format
            Read 1  5' FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 3'
            Read 2  3' UUUUUUUUFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF 5'
          Where UUUUUUUU is a random 8-mer unique molecular identifier (UMI) and FFFFFFF... is the actual fragment to be sequenced. The UMI of Read 2 (R2) is written into the read ID of both reads and removed from the actual sequence.
        required: false
  - name: RRBS-specific options
    arguments: 
      - name: --rrbs 
        type: boolean
        description: Specifies that the input file was an MspI digested RRBS sample (recognition site is CCGG). Single-end or Read 1 sequences (paired-end) which were adapter-trimmed will have a further 2 bp removed from their 3' end. Sequences which were merely trimmed because of poor quality will not be shortened further. Read 2 of paired-end libraries will in addition have the first 2 bp removed from the 5' end (by setting '--clip_r2 2'). This is to avoid using artificial methylation calls from the filled-in cytosine positions close to the 3' MspI site in sequenced fragments. This option is not recommended for users of the Tecan Ovation RRBS Methyl-Seq with TrueMethyl oxBS 1-16 kit (see below).
        required: false
      - name: --non_directional
        type: boolean
        description: Selecting this option for non-directional RRBS libraries will screen quality-trimmed sequences for 'CAA' or 'CGA' at the start of the read and, if found, removes the first two basepairs. Like with the option '--rrbs' this avoids using cytosine positions that were filled-in during the end-repair step. '--non_directional' requires '--rrbs' to be specified as well. Note that this option does not set '--clip_r2 2' in paired-end mode.
        required: false

  - name: Paired-end specific options
    arguments: 
      - name: --paired 
        type: boolean
        description: This option performs length trimming of quality/adapter/RRBS trimmed reads for paired-end files. To pass the validation test, both sequences of a sequence pair are required to have a certain minimum length which is governed by the option --length (see above). If only one read passes this length threshold the other read can be rescued (see option --retain_unpaired). Using this option lets you discard too short read pairs without disturbing the sequence-by-sequence order of FastQ files which is required by many aligners. Trim Galore expects paired-end files to be supplied in a pairwise fashion, e.g. file1_1.fq file1_2.fq SRR2_1.fq.gz SRR2_2.fq.gz ... .
        required: false
      - name: --retain_unpaired  
        type: boolean
        description: If only one of the two paired-end reads became too short, the longer read will be written to either '.unpaired_1.fq' or '.unpaired_2.fq' output files. The length cutoff for unpaired single-end reads is governed by the parameters -r1/--length_1 and -r2/--length_2.
